# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
        Version control is a system used to make changes to a repository that can each be saved individually, so that earlier versions of that repository can be accessed if need. It's useful because it allows you to revert back to old versions if there are any errors made while making changes.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
        A branch is a version of the repository that is not the master. Changes are made in individual branches and merged with the master once they are complete and/or correct.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
        A commit is when you make changes to a repository. A good commit message gives a description of changes made during the commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
        A merge conflict is occurs when there are different changes to the same file and they are both merged to the master branch. Git shows an error when there is a merge conflict and it must be resolved.
